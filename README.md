Course Goals/Description
(a) structure a machine learning problem, 
(b) determine which algorithmic tools are applicable to a given problem, 
(c) apply those algorithmic tools to diverse, interdisciplinary data examples, 
(d) evaluate the performance of your solution, and 
(e) how to accurately interpret and communicate your results. 
This course is a fast-paced, applied introduction to machine learning that arms you with the basic skills you will need in practice to both conduct analyses and effectively communicate your results.
